 # Horiseon Website
- Module 1 Challenge
## Description
- Modified starter code to make images more accessible by adding alt tags
- Changed the div elements to include more semantic HTML to describe the flow of the html doc without necessarily looking at the app
- Reformatted the css styling elements to group together elements that had the same styling rather than repeating styling code over and over
